"""Telink BLE mesh transport - controlling already-provisioned devices.

The sibling of `ble_provision`, which handles getting a factory-default device
*onto* a mesh. This one talks to devices already on one, and is the second
transport for the same protocol `server.py` speaks over TCP.

CONFIRMED ON HARDWARE (2026-07-28)
----------------------------------
Not a translation of somebody else's code taken on faith. Against a wired Cync
switch, via `research`'s `probes/ble_control_probe.py`:

- the session handshake completed with `verify_pairing_response` reporting
  mutual auth verified - the device proved it derived the same key material;
- inbound traffic decrypted into sensible plaintext, with the vendor ID at
  bytes 8:9 exactly where the framing predicts and readable ASCII after it;
- a `set_power` built by this module's layout **changed the switch's state**,
  and cync-lan reported that change over its own TCP connection.

That last point is what makes it evidence rather than a hopeful reading: the
command left over Bluetooth and the confirmation arrived over TCP, so two
independent transports corroborate each other.

**Mesh relay is confirmed too.** A command addressed to one device, sent over
a connection to a *different* device, is relayed and acted on. So a consumer
needs ONE BLE connection to reach the whole mesh - not a connection per
device, which at ~40 nodes would be unworkable.

WHAT IS NOT CONFIRMED
---------------------
`set_power` (`0xD0`) and `set_brightness` (both the `0xF0` and `0xD2` forms) are
confirmed. Colour temperature and RGB are not - they ride the same `0xF0`
family whose brightness member works, so they are better founded than a guess,
but nobody has moved either over this transport.

A surprise came out of testing brightness, and it is recorded rather than
tidied away. **Both** forms changed the brightness of the same wired dimmer:
`0xF0` with the six-byte payload, and `0xD2` with a bare brightness byte -
even though `docs/mesh_opcodes.md` treats `0xD2` as the sol-lamp variant and
`devices.py` only ever sends it to sol lamps over TCP.

Accepted is not the same as equivalent, so the `is_sol_lamp` branch stays and
the default remains whichever form `devices.py` sends for that device class.
The verification channel here is cync-lan's own reporting, which surfaces the
brightness level and little else - it would not reveal a difference in fade
behaviour, in what the device persists across a power cycle, or in sub-percent
handling (`set_fine_brightness` extends the `0xE2` family precisely because the
basic form cannot express it). Sending a device the command its own class is
documented to use costs nothing and forecloses a whole category of side effect
nobody has looked for.

INBOUND STATUS: RECEIVABLE, BUT NOT YET COMPATIBLE WITH SENDING
---------------------------------------------------------------
This has now been wrong in both directions, so the current state is set out
carefully.

Status packets *can* be received and decrypted - 20 of them, in one run, with
`0xDC` and the vendor ID landing exactly where the framing predicts. So the
claim that this firmware "refuses notifications" was wrong.

But BlueZ's `StartNotify` is refused (GATT `Unlikely Error`) **and the rejection
takes the connection down with it** - confirmed, because the next control write
fails with 'Not connected'. A revision of this module then wrongly called that
survivable, misled by the notifications that arrive *before* the rejection:
those come from BlueZ subscribing locally while the device is already reporting
from the `0x01` enable-write, and they say nothing about the link lasting.

So today there is a choice, not a solution:

- **send reliably**: never call `subscribe()`. Confirmed working - power and
  brightness both landed on runs that never attempted a subscription.
- **receive**: call `subscribe()` and accept that the session ends.

`google/python-dimond` has neither problem, because bluepy never writes a CCCD
at all - it registers a delegate and waits. The open question is whether BlueZ
can be made to deliver notifications without its own CCCD write. Two candidates
are untested: writing the descriptor by hand, and relying on the enable-write
alone. Until one of them works, a consumer needing both directions has to
reconnect between them.

WHY THIS MODULE NEVER IMPORTS BLEAK
-----------------------------------
It takes a client rather than creating one. That is the single most important
decision here.

A Home Assistant integration must be able to hand in a connection from HA's
own Bluetooth stack, which is what makes ESPHome Bluetooth proxies work. Had
this module constructed a `BleakClient` itself, proxies would be impossible
and the transport would only ever reach devices in radio range of the machine
running it - useless for a mesh spread across a house.

So the dependency is structural (`GattClient` below), satisfied by
`bleak.BleakClient` and by HA's client alike, and `bleak` stays an optional
extra rather than a hard requirement.

    consumers already use, now confirmed against the vendor implementation

    records happened to be the interesting ones. That inversion discards every
    reachable device - on a 46-node mesh it keeps 6 slots and drops 38.

    Neither rule is a presence test at all: `slot[1]` is the online flag and
    `slot[0]` is what says whether the slot holds a device. A live sweep
    settles it independently of the decompile - device 21 reported
    `slot = [21, 183, 100, 0]` while the TCP transport, watching the same
    device over a completely separate protocol, reported `pow=1 bri=100`.
    Under the inverted rule that device is skipped outright.

    The earlier hardware confirmation still stands and is unaffected:

        set brightness 60  -> decoded 60
        set brightness 25  -> decoded 25
        set power off      -> decoded 0

    Exact agreement at two distinct levels and a return to zero when switched
    off, across a 38-device sweep.

    One timing caveat for consumers: a harvest taken immediately after a
    command can still report the *previous* value - observed once, with the
    next harvest a few seconds later reporting correctly. State propagates
    through the mesh at its own pace; do not read one stale sample as a failed
