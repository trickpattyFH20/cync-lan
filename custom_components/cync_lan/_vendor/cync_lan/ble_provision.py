"""EXPERIMENTAL: BLE GATT provisioning for brand-new (factory-default,
never-provisioned) Telink-mesh Cync/C-by-GE devices - discovery, the
pairing/session-key handshake, and the mesh-credential handoff that gives
a device its permanent mesh name/password/LTK. See
docs/ble_provisioning_protocol.md for the full protocol research this
implements (service/characteristic UUIDs, the encryption algorithm, the
WiFi-credential handoff format for WiFi-capable devices - that last one
is implemented in ble_mesh.BleMeshSession.set_wifi_credentials, since it
rides the ordinary encrypted command path rather than this module's
pairing characteristic).

UNTESTED AGAINST REAL HARDWARE as of this writing. Every byte here is
confirmed from decompiled Cync Android app source, and the pairing/
session-key/command-encryption primitives are independently
cross-validated against `python-dimond` (a real, working, unrelated
Telink-mesh BLE client) - but no live pairing attempt against real
hardware has been made from this module yet. Run this against a spare,
factory-reset device and report back what happens (success, or the exact
error/traceback) - see this module's own CLI --help.

This is a completely separate transport (BLE GATT, via `bleak`) from the
rest of cync-lan, which only ever intercepts the TCP relay of already-
provisioned devices - nothing here is used by, or shared with, the normal
TCP server. `bleak` is an optional dependency (`pip install cync_lan[ble]`)
so it isn't required just to run the everyday TCP relay server.

Only the CLI/BLE-I/O layer needs `bleak` - the crypto/framing functions
below are pure and import-safe without it, so they can be unit tested
without any BLE hardware or the `bleak` package installed.
