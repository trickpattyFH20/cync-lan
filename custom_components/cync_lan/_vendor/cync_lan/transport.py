"""One command surface, whichever wire the command goes out on.

Both transports already existed here - `CyncDevice` speaks TCP to a Wi-Fi
device, `BleMeshSession` speaks Bluetooth to the mesh - and both already had
the same four commands. What they did not have was the same *shape*:

    CyncDevice.set_power(state: int, sub_id=None)
    BleMeshSession.set_power(target: int, on: bool)

    CyncDevice.set_temperature(temp: int, sub_id=None)
    BleMeshSession.set_colour_temp(target, colour_temp, *, is_sol_lamp=False)

A device object on one side, a session plus an explicit target on the other;
`int` against `bool`; one name that does not match; and `is_sol_lamp` a
caller's problem on BLE while TCP works it out itself. Every consumer that
wanted to be transport-agnostic had to bridge that itself, which is most of
what the adapters in a shared Home Assistant entity layer were doing.

**Units are the contract here**, stated once because getting them wrong is
silent. Brightness and colour temperature are both **0-100**, as the wire
speaks them - not kelvin, not 0-255. `cync_lan.classify` has the converters
for callers that speak something else. This is not hypothetical tidiness:
`CyncDevice.set_temperature` refuses anything above 100, and the Home
Assistant integration spent its whole life passing kelvin into it and having
every colour change dropped. Writing the contract down is what found that.
