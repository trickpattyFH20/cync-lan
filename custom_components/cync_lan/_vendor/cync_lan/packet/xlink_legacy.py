"""Decoder for the phone app's legacy Xlink/Frame HDLC-style notification
channel (XlinkTranslatorKt.m14449a()/Xlink.m14391a()/Frame.m14440a() in the
decompiled app, and XlinkNotificationParser.m14437a() on the receive side) -
used by the pure "Hub" Scenes/Schedules commands
(CreateSceneHubCommand/CreateScheduleHubCommand/DeleteSceneHubCommand/
DeleteScheduleHubCommand/ToggleAutomationHubCommand) to report results back
(e.g. a hub-allocated scene_id/schedule_id) asynchronously after the request.

Structurally distinct from cync-lan's own confirmed PacketBuilder wire
format - no delimiters/escaping there, a different msgId width, no embedded
length field - and, critically, whether this notification channel rides the
same TCP relay cync-lan intercepts at all is UNCONFIRMED (same open question
already flagged for the outgoing side of this command family - see
docs/cync_automations.md). This module only provides best-effort DECODING;
cync-lan's own outgoing sends for this command family go through its usual
confirmed envelope (broadcast_control_command), not this frame format, per
the established precedent for delete_scene/delete_schedule/toggle_automation.

Only a decoder is provided (no encoder) - cync-lan has no reason to emit a
genuine Xlink/Frame HDLC frame itself.

    devices.py's `_handle_83_packet`/`_handle_73_mesh_control`). The closing
    delimiter is located here (not by the caller) because a naive
