    0xD0/0x0D exactly, byte-for-byte (see the "Confirmed, already shipping
    in production" table in docs/mesh_opcodes.md). What's unconfirmed is the
    ADDRESSING itself.

    A real-hardware trace found `broadcast_control_command`'s `target_id`

    they already ARE the outer envelope's one 2-byte little-endian
    MeshAddress (`target_id` = low byte, `sub_id` = high byte). Every
    existing single-device command just always hardcodes sub_id=0x00,
    which happens to also be correct for non-multi-gang devices, so nobody
    noticed the high byte was live. Group addresses (32768-65535, exactly
    the `group_id` key cync-lan's own parsed `groups` dict already uses -
    see cloud_api.py's `raw_group["groupID"]`) fit entirely inside that same
    16-bit space - splitting one into (target_id, sub_id) needs no
    PacketBuilder changes at all, since `_require_u8` already accepts any
    byte 0-255 in both fields.

    What's NOT confirmed: whether device firmware actually treats a
    group-range target as "respond as the whole group" - the one real 0x8E
    packet capture available used broadcast 0xFFFF, which is byte-identical
    under both the old and new addressing model and doesn't independently
    prove this. Separately, the app's own multi-device command path looks

    There are two entirely different ways to ask, and which one is correct
    depends on the product. QueryDeviceTimeCommand.N() branches on
    `getDeviceType().getProductType().f31219d`:

        if (!...f31219d) { DefaultImpls.c(TELINK_OPCODE_BYTES, ...) }   <- 0x8E

        new ProductType("CReach", 16, "C-Reach", false, groupPolicy4, true)

    a C-Reach hub, and silently unanswered on everything else. Pass
    hub_product=True for those two; the default is the branch that covers
    every other device.

    The 0x8E branch sends the Companion's TELINK_OPCODE_BYTES, which decode
    as `E8 11 02 10` - opcode 0xE8, Telink vendor id 0x1102, one parameter -

    The 0x46 branch is answered by DeviceTimeNotification.XlinkParser
    instead: the same year/month/day/hour/minute/second, but no DST or
    offset. The two layouts are not interchangeable.

        `is_sol_lamp` (`metadata.opcodes.sol_lamp`, currently true only for
        device type 80). The ORIGINAL version of this method always took
        the `is_sol_lamp=True` branch (real `op=0xD7` via the trustworthy
        `XlinkCommandDelegate.f()`/`mo14054f()` envelope) - correct only
        for that rare product family. For every other real device
        (`is_sol_lamp=False`, virtually all real Cync hardware), the SDK
        instead routes through `h()`/`mo14056h` - the same `0x8E`
        "mesh-relay" substitution bug as set_indicator_led/
        set_motion_sensor_settings/etc. - meaning the embedded `0xD7` is
        actually just the payload's own leading discriminator byte, not
        the real outer op. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "Groups control"
        section.

        cmd_ is PREDICTED via the length formula in both branches (see
        docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "TCP relay envelope research") - not itself
        confirmed against a live capture, unlike the op_code/dispatch
        method. Unlike set_group_power, this targets an individual
        device's own address (self.id) - the payload's 2-byte group
        address is data, not the addressing field; it's the app telling
        one specific device "start/stop listening on this group's pub/sub
        address," not a broadcast to the group.

        array's own leading `0xEE` byte is the same byte the real app
        passes as `mo14054f()`'s op_code argument, then re-embeds inside
        its own payload array (`ArraysKt.plus(f34625q, sceneId)` is passed

        payload given here omits that leading byte to avoid sending it

        Corrected after a real-hardware test of this command's sibling

        Plug - Toggle Power/Plug.md) - see
        PacketBuilder.build_control_packet's repeat_op_code param.

        Operational prerequisite, RESOLVED against decompiled source: the
        real Cync app requires physically waking the sensor first (press
        and hold its off button ~5s until the LED turns green) before it
        accepts settings edits. Confirmed this "discoverable" gate is just
        the device's ordinary mesh online/offline status (real app checks
        MotionSensorServiceDefault.isOnline(), same StateFlow every device
        type reports) - not a BLE/GATT discoverability scan, and no
        programmatic wake command exists anywhere in the app's source. The
        real app's own writeSettings/writeSchedule silently return fake
        success without transmitting anything if the target is offline -
        callers of this method should check bridge/online status first
        (the equivalent signal cync-lan already tracks) rather than send
        blind. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "Operational prerequisite"

        Confirmed via SetMotionSensorScheduleCommand.m14101x() to route
        through the exact same op-family bug already fixed (and confirmed
        working on real hardware) for set_indicator_led/

        0x8E "mesh-relay" op, not 0xF7 (the payload's own leading
        discriminator byte). Unlike those two siblings, this specific
        command has never itself been tested against real hardware -
        cmd_ (0x14) is PREDICTED via the length formula, not confirmed.

        Sent to an individual device (self.id), not a group MeshAddress -
        confirmed the real app fans this out per member device of the

        that method's docstring and docs/mesh_opcodes.md's "Operational

        ordinary online/offline status, not a BLE scan; no programmatic

        brightness: 1-100. wifi_disconnect_blink: blink the indicator when
        WiFi is disconnected.

        A real-hardware test of this exact command with the original guess
        (`op=0xF7`) came back a total no-op (device did nothing, no error -
        fire-and-forget, no ACK checked). Root cause: SetStatusIndicatorSettingsCommand's
        own "opcode array" `{0xF7,0x11,0x02,0x06}` was misread as cync-lan's
        outer `op` (0xF7) + a payload starting `0x11,0x02,0x06,...`.
        Tracing the actual send path in the decompiled app
        (XlinkDeviceManager.CommandDelegate.h()) showed the real outer op
        is a hardcoded 0x8E "mesh-relay" op used across several command
        types (indicator LED, motion sensor settings, scenes) - the 0xF7
        is just that array's own leading byte, i.e. part of the payload,
        not cync-lan's envelope op. Independently corroborated against a
        real captured packet (docs/debugging_sessions/3 devices/
        Plug - Toggle Power/Plug.md): its checksum only balances with
        op=0x8E and no repeated op_code byte before the payload - see
        PacketBuilder.build_control_packet's repeat_op_code param.

        CONFIRMED WORKING on real hardware with the corrected op/payload
        shape below (op=0x8E, cmd_=0x0E, repeat_op_code=False) - no longer
        flagged via _warn_experimental_cmd_code, since both op_code and
        cmd_code are now proven, not predicted. See docs/mesh_opcodes.md.
