"""What a device type *is*, independent of how you talk to it.

Every one of these answers comes from `metadata/model_info.py`'s static
per-type data, so none of it depends on a transport, a connection, or a
running session - and none of it imports Home Assistant. That is the whole
reason it lives here: both Home Assistant integrations need the same
answers, an integration cannot import another integration, and a library is
the only channel they share.

It was written twice before this. `cync_ble/classify.py` said so in its own
docstring - "mirrors cync_lan.devices.CyncDevice's is_light/is_switch logic
exactly" - and it did, for `is_light`: checked against all 157 known types,
the two implementations agreed on every one. `is_dimmable` had drifted on
13 of them, which is the story below.

`CyncDevice`'s properties still exist and still take their per-instance
overrides; they defer here for the computation rather than repeating it.
