"""A Cync device and a Cync cloud that exist only as sockets.

Shipped rather than kept in this package's own tests, because the integration
repository needs the same thing and the protocol lives here. A copy over there
would drift from the parser it is meant to exercise, which is the one failure
mode a protocol simulator cannot afford.

Two pieces:

  VirtualCyncDevice   connects to an nCyncServer and plays the device side
  FakeCloud           listens, and records what a relayed session forwards

**What this can and cannot tell you.** It is built from this package's own
understanding of the protocol, so it can only confirm we are consistent with
ourselves. It is a regression net around behaviour already confirmed on
hardware - it is not evidence about anything unconfirmed, and feeding it our
assumptions will make it agree with our bugs. The integration repository's
docs/hardware_verification.md stays the document that decides what is real.

Import costs nothing at runtime: no test framework is involved, and
`cryptography` is already required by the server for its own certificate.
