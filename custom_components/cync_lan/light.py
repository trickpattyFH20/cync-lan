class CyncLanLightGroup(LightGroup):
    """A Cync device group ("Living Room", etc.) exposed as an aggregate
    light entity, built entirely on Home Assistant's own built-in group-
    light implementation rather than reimplementing it:

    - async_turn_on/async_turn_off forward to every member via the
      standard light.turn_on/light.turn_off services (turning the group on
      turns every member on, and vice versa) - unless the experimental
      option is on, see below.
    - is_on is OR-based across members (LightGroup's `mode` parameter,
      left at its default/falsy - `any`, not `all`) - the group reads as
      "on" if any single member is on.
    - Brightness/color/etc. are averaged across currently-on members by
      LightGroup itself; nothing group-specific needed here for that.

    No _attr_device_info: like HA's own native "Light Group" helper, this
    is a virtual aggregate, not tied to a physical device.

    **Experimental direct-group-command override.** By default, turning
    this on/off issues one command per member device via the fanout above -
    the confirmed-working path. When the experimental option is on and the
    call carries no other attributes (a plain on/off, not
    "set brightness to 50%"), a single command addresses the group's own
    MeshAddress directly instead (cync_lan.devices.set_group_power) -
    unconfirmed against real firmware, which is exactly why it's opt-in.
    This replaces the old standalone group-power switch entity, which did
    the same thing but as a separate control disconnected from the room's
    actual light entity; folding it in here means there's one group control
    per room, not two disagreeing ones. Attribute-carrying calls always use
    the fanout regardless of the option, since the group command carries no
    such data. See switch.py's CyncLanSwitchGroup for the equivalent on
    groups with no light-domain members.

    icon-translations (gold): translation_key (not a static _attr_icon)
    drives icons.json's entity.light.cync_light_group block, which gives
    "off" a proper mdi:lightbulb-group-off instead of showing the "on"
    icon at all times regardless of state. Also declares an icon for
    "unavailable" (same off glyph) - included defensively since it's
    harmless if the frontend doesn't honor it, but unlike the "off" case
    (which mirrors this codebase's already-proven binary_sensor pattern),
    HA's icon-translation state lookup for "unavailable" specifically
    isn't confirmed/documented anywhere; the frontend may just dim
    whatever icon is already showing instead. Safe to set translation_key
    here despite _attr_name also being set below - Entity._name_internal
    checks _attr_name first and never falls through to translation_key
    for naming, so this only affects icon resolution, not the group's
    display name (e.g. "Living Room").

    The point is reach rather than capability: the select/number/switch trio
    already sets everything this does, but none of them can be dropped on a
    light card, and none are exposed to HomeKit or Alexa as a light. This is,
    so "set the porch switch ring to red" works from anywhere that speaks
    lights.

    Two lossy edges, both unavoidable and both deliberate:

    - **Colour is snapped.** The hardware takes an enum of four colours, so an
      arbitrary RGB is mapped to the nearest of them (`nearest_led_color`). The
      entity then reports back the *reference* RGB rather than what was asked
      for, because reporting the requested value would claim a precision the
      device does not have.
    - **On/off maps onto mode**, which has three values, not two. Off is
      `always_off`. On is `always_on` - except when the mode is already
      `normal`, which is already "on" in every sense that matters, and
      overwriting it would silently destroy a setting the user chose from the
      select entity. So turning on a ring that is already in `normal` leaves it
      there.

    `assumed_state` for the same reason as its siblings: the device never
    reports this back over the mesh.
