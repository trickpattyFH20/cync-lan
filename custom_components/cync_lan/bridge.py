"""Adapter that lets the unmodified cync_lan protocol/server code push state
directly into Home Assistant entities instead of publishing MQTT discovery
JSON.

devices.py (in the upstream `cync_lan` package this integration depends on)
calls a fixed set of methods on a module-level `g.mqtt_client` singleton to
report state changes and command acknowledgements - see MQTTClient in
cync_lan/mqtt_client.py for the original MQTT-based implementation. This
class implements the exact same call surface (verified against every
`g.mqtt_client.<method>` call site in devices.py) but instead of touching
MQTT, it records the latest EntityState per (dev_id, sub_id) and notifies
entities via Home Assistant's dispatcher, which they listen to in
async_added_to_hass.

One addition needed a small, matching change in devices.py itself:
report_unknown_device_id() (see below) is called from
_process_73_mesh_info's existing "Received MeshInfo for unknown device ID"
branch, with a no-op mirror added to MQTTClient for the MQTT-based add-on
so that branch doesn't need an isinstance check to stay safe for both.
